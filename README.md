# Notes

> I create notes for just everything. In this repository i have added notes for c++ STL, java, algorithms, DSA, System Design, Design Patterns, programming and anything related to software engineering. Feel free to use it if you find it useful. I have written all the notes for my personal use. Do verify the correctness of my notes before you use it because i may be wrong too :)

###  [CPP STL](https://github.com/narendracode/notes/blob/main/cpp_stl.txt)
This will save time browsing through the web to find syntax, implementation etc for C++ STL documentation.
