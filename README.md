# Notes

> I create notes for just everything. In this repository i have added notes for c++ STL, java, algorithms, DSA, System Design, Design Patterns, programming and anything related to software engineering. Feel free to use it if you find it useful. I have written all the notes for my personal use. Do verify the correctness of my notes before you use it because i may be wrong too :)

###  [CPP STL](./cpp)
This will save time browsing through the web to find syntax, implementation etc for C++ STL documentation.

## [System Design](./system_design)


### Note :
These set of notes would grow as per time, i will keep adding more resources here.

### Some of the resource which i often refer :
##### leetcode
##### geeksforgeeks
##### hackerrank
##### codeforces
##### codechef
##### atcoder
##### educative.io
##### coursera
##### hackerearth
##### refactoring.guru
